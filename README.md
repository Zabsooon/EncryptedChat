# EncryptedChat based on P2P connection.

# Building

To build the EncryptedChat we are using Conan and cmake:

There are two ways to build this project, we will build it locally, so you are going to need Qt installed on your system

To build the project run this commands:

```
$ mkdir build
$ cmake -S. -Bbuild
$ cd build
$ make
```

By now you should have executable file


Later on we will try to automate that process later or wait for conan-team to fix it...
But for now we have to work on it locally and hope for the best...
